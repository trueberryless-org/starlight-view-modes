Adds a route data object accessible on Starlight pages using `Astro.locals.starlightViewModes` containing information about all the modes available on the current page. This can be useful to create custom view modes switchers or just access additional data about the view modes.

See the [“View Modes Data” guide](https://starlight-view-modes.netlify.app/view-modes-data/) for more information.
