A [Starlight](https://starlight.astro.build) plugin adding different view mode capabilities to your documentation website.

- No client-side third-party dependencies
- Mobile support is working for Zen Mode
- Many options to configurate plugin for your website (look [here](/en/configuration))
- Zen mode and more to come...

## Prerequisites

You will need to have a Starlight website set up.
If you don't have one yet, you can follow the ["Getting Started"](https://starlight.astro.build/getting-started) guide in the Starlight docs to create one.

## Installation

import { Steps } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";
import { PackageManagers } from "starlight-package-managers";

<Steps>

1. Starlight View Modes is a Starlight [plugin](https://starlight.astro.build/reference/plugins/) that you can install using your favorite package manager:

   <PackageManagers pkg="starlight-view-modes" />

2. Configure the plugin in your Starlight [configuration](https://starlight.astro.build/reference/configuration/#plugins) in the `astro.config.mjs` file.

   ```diff lang="js"
   // astro.config.mjs
   import starlight from '@astrojs/starlight'
   import { defineConfig } from 'astro/config'
   +import starlightViewModes from 'starlight-view-modes'

   export default defineConfig({
     integrations: [
       starlight({
   +      plugins: [starlightViewModes()],
         title: 'My Docs',
       }),
     ],
   })
   ```

3. [Start the development server](https://starlight.astro.build/getting-started/#start-the-development-server) to see the plugin in action.

</Steps>

The Starlight View Modes plugin behavior can be tweaked using various [configuration options](/en/configuration).

## Component overrides

The Starlight View Modes plugin uses a Starlight [component override](https://starlight.astro.build/guides/overriding-components/) for the [`PageTitle`](https://starlight.astro.build/reference/overrides/#pagetitle), [`SocialIcons`](https://starlight.astro.build/reference/overrides/#socialicons), and [`TableOfContents`](https://starlight.astro.build/reference/overrides/#tableofcontents) components.

If you have a custom `PageTitle` component override in your Starlight project, you will need to manually render the `PageTitle` component from the Starlight View Modes plugin in your custom component:

```diff lang="astro"
---
// src/components/overrides/PageTitle.astro
import Default from '@astrojs/starlight/components/PageTitle.astro'
+import StarlightViewModesPageTitle from 'starlight-view-modes/components/PageTitle.astro'
---

<Default><slot /></Default>
<p>Custom content in the PageTitle override</p>
+<StarlightViewModesPageTitle />
```

The same logic applies to the `SocialIcons` and `TableOfContents` components.
