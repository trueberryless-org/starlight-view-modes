Starlight View Modes exposes information about the view modes in your project.
This guide explains how to use Starlight View Modes’ data.

## What is view modes data?

Starlight View Modes data is an object containing the information about all the view modes in your project.
It includes information like the currently active view mode.

## Using view modes data

The `currentMode` field contains the currently active view mode.

You can access this data from the `Astro.locals.starlightViewModes` global in Astro components:

```astro title="example.astro"
---
const { currentMode } = Astro.locals.starlightViewModes
//          ^ The currently active view mode
---
```

This can be useful for example to conditionally render content based on the active view mode.

import { Preview } from '@hideoo/starlight-plugins-docs-components'
import ViewModesDataExample from '../../components/ViewModesDataExample.astro'

<Preview>

```astro title="ActiveViewMode.astro" "Astro.locals.starlightViewModes.currentMode"
---
const { currentMode } = Astro.locals.starlightViewModes;
---

{currentMode == "default" && <p>Normal Mode</p>}
{currentMode == "zen-mode" && <p>Zen Mode</p>}
```
