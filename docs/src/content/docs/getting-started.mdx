## Prerequisites

You will need to have a Starlight website set up.
If you don't have one yet, you can follow the ["Getting Started"](https://starlight.astro.build/getting-started) guide in the Starlight docs to create one.

## Installation

import { Steps } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";
import { PackageManagers } from "starlight-package-managers";

<Steps>

1. Starlight View Modes is a Starlight [plugin](https://starlight.astro.build/reference/plugins/) that you can install using your favorite package manager:

   <PackageManagers pkg="starlight-view-modes" />

2. Configure the plugin in your Starlight [configuration](https://starlight.astro.build/reference/configuration/#plugins) in the `astro.config.mjs` file.

   ```diff lang="js"
   // astro.config.mjs
   import starlight from '@astrojs/starlight'
   import { defineConfig } from 'astro/config'
   +import starlightViewModes from 'starlight-view-modes'

   export default defineConfig({
     integrations: [
       starlight({
   +      plugins: [starlightViewModes()],
         title: 'My Docs',
       }),
     ],
   })
   ```

3. [Start the development server](https://starlight.astro.build/getting-started/#start-the-development-server) to see the plugin in action.
