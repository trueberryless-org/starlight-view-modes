Starlight View Modes relies on Starlight's built-in support for [internationalization](https://starlight.astro.build/guides/i18n/) to provide multilingual support for your website with view modes with features like routing or fallback content.

See the [Starlight internationalization documentation](https://starlight.astro.build/guides/i18n/) for more information on how to configure i18n in your Starlight website.

## Configure i18n

Configure internationalization in your Starlight project by following the Starlight [“Configure i18n”](https://starlight.astro.build/guides/i18n/#configure-i18n) guide.
Internationalization is automatically configured for all view modes.

## Fallback content

Similar to Starlight, Starlight View Modes expects you to create equivalent pages in all your languages.
For example, if you have an `en/guide/hello.md` file, create an `hello.md` for each other language you support.
This allows Starlight and the Starlight View Modes plugin to provide automatic fallback content for pages that have not yet been translated.

Read more about fallback content in the Starlight [“Internationalization”](https://starlight.astro.build/guides/i18n/#fallback-content) guide.

## Translate the view modes UI

The Starlight View Modes plugin allows you to translate the default UI strings used in the view modes so that your website can be fully localized and readers can enjoy a seamless experience in their preferred language.
