Starlight View Modes relies on Starlight's built-in support for [internationalization](https://starlight.astro.build/guides/i18n/) to provide multilingual support.
Follow the Starlight [“Configure i18n”](https://starlight.astro.build/guides/i18n/#configure-i18n) guide and the Starlight View Modes plugin will automatically create your internationalized routes and pages.

## Translate the view modes UI

The Starlight View Modes plugin allows you to translate the default UI strings used in the view modes so that your website can be fully localized and readers can enjoy a seamless experience in their preferred language.

import { I18n } from "@hideoo/starlight-plugins-docs-components";

<I18n
  label="Starlight View Modes"
  translations={
    import("../../../../packages/starlight-view-modes/translations")
  }
/>
